# Log-Analytics-Cost-Optimizer

Recommend and automate safe telemetry-retention changes while preserving security and compliance value.

## Problem statement

An ingestion-policy request is evaluated for protected tables, retention evidence, target approval, and deterministic rollback before data is routed to lower-cost tiers.

A production implementation can still fail even when every resource deploys successfully. The material risk is apparently successful automation that lacks bounded scope, a reproducible denial path, or evidence operators can use during review and recovery. The design therefore treats Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Data Explorer, and the surrounding identity and evidence controls as one reviewable system rather than unrelated configuration tasks.

## Example case study

### Situation

A security program's Sentinel bill grows faster than its estate because every log is retained at premium analytics rates. The optimizer identifies cold, high-volume tables and plans safe tiering without silently discarding investigation evidence.

### Response

A workspace bill rises because verbose tables retain low-value data too long. The optimizer attributes ingestion and retention to owners and proposes table-specific changes while keeping security-critical telemetry outside automatic cost cutting.

The team first exercises the repository's synthetic approved and denied fixtures. An approved request must produce the same idempotent plan on replay; a stale, unscoped, public, or unapproved request must fail before an Azure adapter is allowed to run.

### Expected outcome

Stakeholders receive a decision package they can attach to a change record: requested scope, controls evaluated, the reason for approval or denial, and the explicit handoff to live integration. The example supports design review and incident rehearsal without pretending that a local test changed Azure.

## Architecture

Resource Graph and usage queries profile ingestion by workspace/table/source. A rules engine models commitment tiers, table plans, transformations, retention, archive/export to Storage or Data Explorer, and requires approval before changes.

Primary services: `Azure Monitor`, `Log Analytics`, `Data Explorer`, `Logic Apps`, `Storage`.

This repository implements the first production-oriented vertical slice: a
fail-closed, adapter-neutral control plane that validates tenant scope,
freshness, approvals, secretless identity, private access, and the exact
project action before producing a deterministic execution plan. Azure adapters
consume that plan; they are deliberately outside the local simulator so local
tests cannot claim a live cloud change occurred.

The upper boundary names the principal services and technologies used by this repository. The lower boundary shows the implemented control flow: desired state is validated, provider action remains an explicit integration gate, and sanitized evidence is retained for review and deterministic replay.

Azure product icons come from [Microsoft's official Azure Architecture Icons](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/icons/). Open-source marks are sourced from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) when shown; each mark identifies its respective technology.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.11+ and Git. No Azure credentials are required.

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
python3 src/control_plane.py --request examples/approved-request.json
```

The command emits canonical JSON with a stable idempotency key. The denied
fixture exits with status 2 and explains the failed invariants.

## Security boundaries

- Managed identity or workload identity only; embedded credentials are denied.
- Public network access and stale evidence are denied.
- Production and break-glass targets require explicit approval.
- The IaC entry point is opt-in and defaults to deploying nothing.
- Evidence output contains identifiers and decisions, never credential values.

## Verification and limitations

Local validation covers 13 tests, deterministic replay, JSON parsing, Python
compilation, ignore hygiene, and Bicep compilation when a compiler is present.
It does **not** prove Azure deployment, service licensing, quota, data-plane
permissions, provider/API availability, cloud failover, load, cost, or teardown.
See [`docs/test-matrix.md`](docs/test-matrix.md) and [`docs/runbook.md`](docs/runbook.md) before any integration trial.
