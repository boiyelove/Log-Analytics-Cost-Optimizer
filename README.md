# Log-Analytics-Cost-Optimizer

Recommend and automate safe telemetry-retention changes while preserving security and compliance value.

## Example synopsis

An ingestion-policy request is evaluated for protected tables, retention evidence, target approval, and deterministic rollback before data is routed to lower-cost tiers.

## Real-world scenario

A security program's Sentinel bill grows faster than its estate because every log is retained at premium analytics rates. The optimizer identifies cold, high-volume tables and plans safe tiering without silently discarding investigation evidence.

## Architecture

Resource Graph and usage queries profile ingestion by workspace/table/source. A rules engine models commitment tiers, table plans, transformations, retention, archive/export to Storage or Data Explorer, and requires approval before changes.

Primary services: `Azure Monitor`, `Log Analytics`, `Data Explorer`, `Logic Apps`, `Storage`.

This repository implements the first production-oriented vertical slice: a
fail-closed, adapter-neutral control plane that validates tenant scope,
freshness, approvals, secretless identity, private access, and the exact
project action before producing a deterministic execution plan. Azure adapters
consume that plan; they are deliberately outside the local simulator so local
tests cannot claim a live cloud change occurred.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.11+ and Git. No Azure credentials are required.

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
python3 src/control_plane.py --request examples/approved-request.json
```

The command emits canonical JSON with a stable idempotency key. The denied
fixture exits with status 2 and explains the failed invariants.

## Security boundaries

- Managed identity or workload identity only; embedded credentials are denied.
- Public network access and stale evidence are denied.
- Production and break-glass targets require explicit approval.
- The IaC entry point is opt-in and defaults to deploying nothing.
- Evidence output contains identifiers and decisions, never credential values.

## Verification and limitations

Local validation covers 13 tests, deterministic replay, JSON parsing, Python
compilation, ignore hygiene, and Bicep compilation when a compiler is present.
It does **not** prove Azure deployment, service licensing, quota, data-plane
permissions, provider/API availability, cloud failover, load, cost, or teardown.
See [[`docs/test-matrix.md`](docs/test-matrix.md)](docs/test-matrix.md) and [[`docs/runbook.md`](docs/runbook.md)](docs/runbook.md) before any integration trial.
